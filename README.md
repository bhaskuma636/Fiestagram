# Fiestagram 

[Live Demo](https://fiestagram-ks.herokuapp.com/#/home)

Fiestagram is a clone of the instagram app, where users can share and comment on each other's posts. The app is built with a Rails/PostGreSQL backend and React/Redux frontend. The project was designed and implemented within a 2 week period. Current features include User authentication, Posts CRUD (create, read, update and delete) and comments, though I plan to continue adding features and improvements in the future.
